prototype.

3. Describe the difficulties you faced (if any) while working on the challenge and how you tackled them.
Main difficulty was just debugging and trying to get the components to render on the screen; also the main

which response to return.

Probably around 2-3? Not sure, it definitely will vary from week to week depending on what
